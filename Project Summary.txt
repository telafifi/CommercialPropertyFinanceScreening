Project Description:

The commercial property financing application tool is a scoring system developed for banks/lenders to evaluate the credit risks 
in commercial mortgage applications. This tool reads public data such as US population by City, US Treasury Bond yield
and capitalization rate (cap rate) by property type and by city. These public data are then combined with user-input loan specific 
data such as loan-to-value ratio (LTV), debt-service-coverage ratio (DSCR), property location and borrower's financials. 
The overall score is used for initial decision of either declining the application or further review by credit manager.

The output of the project is a user-friendly excel spreadsheet with borrower score, property score and overall score with credit
decision (next step) and sugguested interest rate for the application.
